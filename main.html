        <h1> Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	     <p>I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills. Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it. In college, I originally studied communications. After obtaining my bachelor's degree in communications, I accepted a job as an editor at a publishing firm. I was responsible for correcting grammatical and stylistic mistakes in clients' work. While I was good at my job and worked hard, the position didn't excite me, so I searched for something more fulfilling.
